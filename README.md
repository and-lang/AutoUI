## First Assignment

"The goal of this task is the development of a simple app which provides live views of different sensor data. The app
should consist of a main Activity to choose from the available sensor views:Accelerometer and GPS location. Each
sensor view should be provided by a separate Activity. The presented sensor data should automatically refresh to show
the latest measurement. Reduce energy consumption by correctly registering and unregistering sensor listeners in the
corresponding lifecycle callbacks. Make sure to document your code in english language. Test your app.
1. Develop the app and its main Activity. The activity should at least have 2 buttons, one for each sensor. A button touch should start the corresponding Activitiy of the selected sensor.
2. Add an Activity for a live view of accelerometer data (TYPE_ACCELEROMETER). Provide the values of all three physical axes (x, y, and z).
3. Add an Activity for a live view of the current GPS position. Provide at least the longitude and latitude of the position.
4. Extend at least one of the activities with a more sophisticated visualisation, e.g., a history diagram of all measured accelerometer values, a map visualization with device position etc.."
